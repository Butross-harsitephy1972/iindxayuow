Man, just walked outta the theater, eyes still adjusting to the damn bright lights, and all I can think about is this strange mix of cosmic chaos and human drama they called Gap. My back’s just creaking and groaning from those old seats, swear they were designed by someone who doesn’t believe in comfort, and all these popcorn crumbs sticking like tiny satellites in orbit around me. Okay, so this flick, it’s like someone threw a Rubik's Cube into the air and 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮ed it hitting the ground in slow motion. 

> There’s this scene, right? Where everything goes silent and you can hear folks shifting and rustling around you, like a weird communal dance where nobody even knows the steps, yet it’s somehow beautiful. It’s like trying to remember a dream but the details just keep slipping away. In the  , there’s a street chase but set in some alternate universe where gravity's optional and the laws of physics are more like gentle suggestions. Felt like my brain was trying to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 a whole new set of logic while also trying to figure out where I put that soda.

And oh man, the main character, I swear he’s got this whole energy of someone who knows they’re dreaming but doesn’t know how to wake up. Reminded me of that one time my truck got stuck in mud, spinning wheels and all, feeling kinda existential about the mud closing in. They sure know how to frame a shot though, like each scene’s a postcard from a place I don’t quite understand but am deeply curious about.

Somebody told me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   when it drops, and honestly, I might just do that, just to pause and rewind that one bit with the cat. You'll know it when you see it. Man, that cat was like Schrödinger’s meme or something. Anyway, it’s one hell of a 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 if you’ve got a thing for  s that make you feel like you’ve been staring at a Magic Eye without getting the picture.

So, yeah, if you get the chance, you should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , maybe help me figure out if that one scene with the balloon is supposed to mean anything or if my brain’s just gone rogue.

let gapThoughts = [undefined, null, some sense, 42];
function processGap(gap) {
    if(gap === undefined || gap === null) {
        return a lack or void, kinda like my thoughts rn;
    }
    return some semblance of understanding;
}
